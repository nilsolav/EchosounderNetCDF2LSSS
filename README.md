# EchosounderNetCDF
This repository reads and writes the interpreation masks for fisheries acoustic

The mask will be region based and the grid  will be time and depth. The sound speed used to calculate the depth will be stored as metadata. 

The region will be defined to include both _in_ and _on_ the region outline. Donut shapes will be supported.
